# Build a 'New Releases' music site using React

This week's project is to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

What we learned:

- How to write React components
- How to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- How to use React props to feed information to components
- How to structure React projects into small chunks

For this project I started to structure on how to divide the code into different components. I created 4 components which are App.js, Album.js, Header.js and Icons.js.

This proejct was very fun but it was a bit heard to grasp in the beginning. It worked but I wasn't sure if I knew why, and I was in contact with my team and we helped eachother out and when I had to explain what I had done to my teammates I started to understand. So in the end of the week it turned out really good.

This is my deployed site: https://music-releases.netlify.com/
And this what I have done to complete the requirement for the project:

- For each album we displayed: cover image, album name, the name of each artist involved.
- When hovering over an album it shows a play button
- When hovering over the play button, it grows.
- When clicking on the album, it links to the album's external url in the data
- When clicking on an artist, it links to the artist's external url in the data
- The page is responsive, showing 4 albums per row on desktop, 2 per row on tablet, and 1 per row on mobile.
- Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.

If I would have more time I would have tried to make some new components to render a list of playlists in a sidebar.
